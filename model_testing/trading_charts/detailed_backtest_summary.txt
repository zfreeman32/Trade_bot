Least active sell model: LSTM (0 signals)
Most active buy model: LSTM (15 signals)
Least active buy model: Conv1D (0 signals)

IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED:
----------------------------------------
1. SEPARATE FEATURE PREPROCESSING:
   - Sell models use sell-specific lag features
   - Buy models use buy-specific lag features
   - Resolves feature mismatch issues

2. ADAPTIVE THRESHOLDS:
   - 30th percentile-based thresholds instead of fixed 0.5
   - Each model gets optimized threshold
   - Minimum threshold of 0.3 enforced

3. PROBABILITY CALIBRATION:
   - Sigmoid calibration applied to raw predictions
   - Improves probability interpretation
   - Better handles focal loss trained models

4. SIGNAL COOLDOWN SYSTEM:
   - 10-period minimum between signals
   - Prevents signal clustering
   - Cleaner signal generation

5. IMPROVED SCALING:
   - Separate scalers for sell/buy models
   - Less aggressive quantile range (15-85%)
   - Gentler clipping (-5 to 5)

6. ENSEMBLE CAPABILITY:
   - Weighted voting ensemble implemented
   - Lower thresholds for ensemble signals
   - Can combine multiple model predictions

ISSUES ADDRESSED:
----------------------------------------
BEFORE:
- Only Conv1D_Sell and LSTM_Buy models generated signals
- Most models stuck at low probabilities (~0.27-0.43)
- Multiple consecutive signals when prob stayed high
- Fixed 0.5 threshold not optimal for all models
- Feature preprocessing mismatch between sell/buy models

AFTER:
- Adaptive thresholds optimize each model's performance
- Probability calibration improves signal quality
- Signal cooldown prevents clustering
- Separate preprocessing for each model type
- Better feature scaling and handling

RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------------------------------
1. MONITOR MODEL PERFORMANCE:
   - Track signal accuracy over time
   - Adjust thresholds based on performance
   - Consider retraining underperforming models

2. ENSEMBLE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Train meta-learner for ensemble weights
   - Use validation data for weight optimization
   - Consider stacking with different base models

3. THRESHOLD TUNING:
   - Experiment with different percentiles (70-85)
   - Consider market condition-specific thresholds
   - Implement dynamic threshold adjustment

4. FEATURE ENGINEERING:
   - Add market regime indicators
   - Include volatility-based features
   - Consider correlation-based features

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

Buy model features: 101 total
Scaling method: RobustScaler with quantile_range=(15.0, 85.0)
