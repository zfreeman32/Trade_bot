# EURUSD Trading Model Testing Framework Technical Summary

## Overview

A comprehensive backtesting and real-time evaluation framework for deep learning trading models on EURUSD data. The system supports multiple model architectures (LSTM, GRU, Conv1D, Conv1D_LSTM) with separate signal generation pipelines for buy and sell predictions, advanced ensemble methods, and sophisticated signal optimization techniques.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Dual-Pipeline Model Management
- **Segregated Model Types**: Separate loading and processing pipelines for sell vs buy signal models
- **Model Architecture Support**: LSTM, GRU, Conv1D, and Conv1D_LSTM neural network architectures
- **Custom Loss Integration**: Focal loss function handling for class-imbalanced financial data
- **Memory Optimization**: Independent feature preprocessing and scaling per model type

### 2. Advanced Feature Engineering
- **Model-Specific Lag Features**: 
  - Sell models: 5 distinct lag periods [70, 24, 10, 74, 39]
  - Buy models: 5 distinct lag periods [61, 93, 64, 60, 77]
- **Indicator Lag Integration**: Multi-period lagged versions of RSI, CCI, EFI, CMO, ROC, ROCR
- **Volume Transformations**: Log transformation, Winsorization, and percentile ranking
- **Rolling Statistics**: Target-specific rolling means and standard deviations
- **Technical Indicator Suite**: 70+ technical analysis indicators via TA-Lib integration

### 3. Adaptive Signal Generation
- **Dynamic Threshold Calculation**: 75th percentile-based adaptive thresholds instead of fixed 0.5
- **Probability Calibration**: Sigmoid calibration applied to raw model outputs for improved probability interpretation
- **Signal Cooldown System**: Configurable minimum period (10 samples) between consecutive signals to prevent clustering
- **Ensemble Voting**: Weighted voting mechanism combining multiple model predictions

### 4. Robust Data Processing
- **Separate Scaling Pipelines**: Independent RobustScaler instances for sell/buy models with quantile_range(15.0, 85.0)
- **Conservative Clipping**: Scaled features clipped to [-5, 5] range to prevent extreme values
- **Missing Value Handling**: Forward-fill, backward-fill, and zero-fill strategies
- **Infinite Value Protection**: Systematic replacement of infinite values with bounded alternatives

### 5. Comprehensive Backtesting Engine
- **Sliding Window Prediction**: 120-period lookback windows for sequential prediction
- **Real-time Signal Tracking**: Live signal generation with timestamp and price correlation
- **Performance Metrics**: Signal count, rate, probability distributions, and threshold effectiveness
- **Historical Validation**: Large-scale backtesting on up to 50,000 historical samples

### 6. Advanced Visualization and Reporting
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Multi-panel Plotly visualizations with price charts, probability tracking, and signal analysis
- **Signal Overlay**: Visual representation of buy/sell signals directly on price charts
- **Performance Analytics**: Model-specific signal statistics and comparative analysis
- **Export Capabilities**: HTML interactive charts, static PNG exports, and comprehensive text summaries

## Key Technical Innovations

### Probability Calibration Framework
- **Sigmoid Calibration**: Maps raw neural network outputs to well-calibrated probabilities
- **Distribution Awareness**: Accounts for focal loss training effects on probability distributions
- **Threshold Optimization**: Model-specific threshold calculation based on historical performance

### Signal Quality Enhancement
- **Temporal Filtering**: Cooldown periods prevent signal oversaturation during high-probability periods
- **Adaptive Sensitivity**: Dynamic threshold adjustment based on model-specific probability distributions
- **Ensemble Aggregation**: Lower threshold requirements (0.4) for ensemble signals to capture consensus

### Memory and Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Models loaded on-demand with error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Vectorized Operations**: Batch processing of technical indicators and feature transformations
- **Efficient Windowing**: Optimized sliding window creation for real-time prediction
- **Progressive Processing**: Chunked backtesting with progress tracking and intermediate reporting
