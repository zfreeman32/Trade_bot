# Monthly Trading Strategy Based on Quantified Patterns
def monthly_trading_signals(stock_df):
    """
    Generate trading signals based on a hypothetical monthly trading strategy
    that utilizes quantified patterns and anomalies for entry and exit points.

    Parameters:
    stock_df (DataFrame): DataFrame containing stock prices with a datetime index and 'Close' prices.

    Returns:
    DataFrame: Signals DataFrame with 'signal' column containing 'long', 'short', or 'neutral' signals.
