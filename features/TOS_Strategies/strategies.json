        "description": "Description Accumulation/Disribution is a strategy created by Domenico D'Errico in attempt to identify and utilize market phases stipulated by Dow theory. The strategy recognizes accumulation and distribution market phases based on range or average true range compression and adds simulated buy and sell orders accordingly. The strategy recognizes the accumulation market phase if the price is in downtrend, but the price move is slowing down while gaining short-term momentum. Conversely, the distribution phase is recognized if the price is in uptrend while losing short-term momentum and the overall price move shows signs of slowing down. The slowing down of the price move, or range compression, is evaluated by the Accumulation/Distribution study. Two types of range measurement can be used with this study: high-low range or average true range. A simulated buy to open order is added if all of the following conditions are fulfilled: Range compression is detected. A higher 12-week low is registered. The close price breaks above a recent highest level. Average volume has recently increased. Two past average values are compared: a recent average value and a value that is offset from it by the average length. A simulated sell to close order is added when the close price falls below a recent low. Input Parameters Parameter Description length Defines the period for which the high-low range or the average true range is calculated. factor Defines the upper limit (exclusive) of the recent to past range ratio for the range compression to be recognized. vol ratio Defines the lower limit (exclusive) of the recent to past average volume ratio for the volume condition to be fulfilled. vol avg length Defines the length of the moving average calculated for volume. vol delay Defines the offset from the current bar to find the recent value of the average volume. mode Defines whether to use the high-low range or the average true range in the calculations.

As it is discussed in his article \u201cADX Breakouts\u201d, this strategy is to be applied to stock symbols that satisfy certain price range criteria; to find these symbols, use the ADXBreakoutsFilter study . Based on Average Directional Index (ADX) , the strategy helps spot and utilize high-volatility price breakouts. The main idea of using ADX in this indicator is a popular suggestion that high ADX values signify high levels of volatility. Values greater than 40 are perceived as a signal for strong breakout price action. Thus, the primary triggering condition is ADX crossing the level of 40, with price being at its 15-day highest (a customizable default value). If such an event occurs, the strategy records the high price and adds a simulated long entry order as soon as price exceeds this value by a certain amount. This amount is set by default to 50 cents. Since the strategy is long entry only, you might want to use other strategies for exits, e.g., TrailingStopLX . Input Parameters highest length Defines the period upon which the highest price is determined. adx length Defines the period for ADX calculation. adx level Defines the threshold ADX value for the strategy to trigger a signal. offset Defines the minimum amount by which the price should exceed its recorded highest value.

        "description": "Description The ATRHighSMABreakoutsLE is a long entry strategy developed by Ken Calhoun. As it is discussed in his article \u201cATR Breakout Entries,\u201d this strategy is to be applied to stock symbols that satisfy certain price range and volume criteria; to find these symbols, use the ATRHighSMABreakoutsFilter study in the Stock Hacker. Akin to Mr. Calhoun\u2019s previous installment, ADXBreakouts , this strategy explores high-volatility price breakouts in order to produce important long entry signals. In ATRHighSMABreakouts, breakout calculations are based on two popular technical indicators: the Average True Range (ATR) and a simple moving average (SMA) of the close price. The rationale of ATR employment here is the observation that its values increase as the daily high-low ranges expand. For a buy signal, this will need to be confirmed by a moving average crossover. The primary triggering condition for the long entry signal is ATR being at its 14-day highest and price being above its 100-day SMA (both numbers are customizable via input parameters). If this condition is fulfilled, the strategy records the high price and adds a simulated long entry order as soon as price exceeds this value by a certain amount. This amount is set by default to 50 cents. There are also two extra conditions which may be applied in order to refine the signals: a wide-range candle and volume increase (both turned off by default). Turning on the wide-range candle filter will have the strategy add a simulated order only if the height of the candle at which the primary condition has triggered is at least 1.5 times greater than the average. Turning on the volume filter will add checking if the volume has increased since the last candle. Since the strategy is long entry only, you might want to use other strategies for exits, e.g., TrailingStopLX . Input Parameters length Defines the period for ATR calculation. average length Defines the period for SMA calculation. offset Defines the minimum amount by which the price should exceed its recorded highest value. wide range candle Defines whether the condition should only trigger at a candle whose height is at least 1.5 times greater than the average. volume increase Defines whether the condition should only trigger if the volume has increased since the last candle.

        "description": "Description The Donchian strategy is a technical indicator based on the Donchian channel, allowing for several levels of complexity. The current implementation and default values of this channel are presented by Oscar G. Cagigas in his article \"The Degree of Complexity\". In order to build the Donchian channel, the system registers the highest high and the lowest low price on two periods (by default, 40 and 15). The upper band value is equal to the highest high on the shorter period if there is a simulated short position; otherwise, the highest high on the longer period is used. The lower band uses the lowest low on the shorter period if there is a simulated long position; if the position is short or absent, the lowest price on the longer period is plotted instead. At the lowest complexity level, the strategy adds simulated orders according to the following rules: Buy To Open . The high price is greater than the previously calculated highest high on the longer period. Sell To Open . The low price is less than the previously calculated lowest low on the longer period. Buy To Close . The high price is greater than the previously calculated highest high on the shorter period. Sell To Close . The low price is less than the previously calculated lowest low on the shorter period. To increase the complexity of the system to the medium level, you can add either a volatility filter or an ATR -based stop loss. The volatility filter affects simulated entry orders: in addition to the previously described conditions, this filter enables checking whether the previous true range was less than its average value multiplied by a factor. The stop-loss affects simulated exit orders: for Sells, it checks whether the close price is less than the entry price minus the Average True Range (ATR) multiplied by the stop factor. For Buys, it's vice versa: the high price needs to exceed the entry price by the ATR multiplied by the stop factor. In order to set the strategy to the medium level, set either the atr factor or the atr stop factor to a non-zero value. If you prefer to use the highest complexity level, make sure both parameters are non-zero. Input Parameters entry length The longer period, in bars. exit length The shorter period, in bars. atr length The number of bars used in the calculation of the Average True Range. atr factor The factor used in the calculation of the volatility filter.

        "description": "Description The First-Hour Breakout strategy adds simulated orders based on the price range calculated for the first hour of the regular trading session. By default, it also compares the volume traded last night to the average nightly volume over the last five days (see the article on the Cumulative Overnight Volume for details). In addition to the first-hour range check and the overnight volume check, the strategy performs several checks at specified timestamps during the trading day. Note that since thinkScript uses timestamps in Eastern Standard Time (EST), the default numbers in the input parameters are adjusted accordingly. The simulated orders will be added based on the following algorithm (all timestamps mentioned are default and can be modified using the input parameters): At 9:30 am Eastern Standard Time (EST), the strategy compares the total volume traded last night to the average nightly volume over the last five days. If the overnight volume is greater than the average, the strategy detects a volatility bias and will perform the next step. If the overnight volume is less than or equal to the average, no simulated orders will be added during this day and the check will be repeated at the same time the next day. At 10:30 am EST, the strategy registers the price range of the first hour of the trading day. If the price rises above or falls below this range at any moment from 10:45 am EST to 3:45 pm EST, the strategy will add a simulated order: a buy to open order when the price rises and a sell to open order when it falls. No simulated orders to open will be added after 3:45 pm EST. All open simulated positions will be closed with the opposite simulated orders at 4:15 pm EST. Note that you can turn off the overnight volume check by setting the use filter parameter to no .

To recognize such stocks, use thinkorswim Stock Hacker. While trading the gaps is a base for many technical indicators, this strategy is about the proportions of such a gap. On certain intraday charts, sufficient gaps might indicate that the stock is currently being overbought or oversold, which may result in a reversal. By default, the GapReversalLE adds a simulated buy order if the price has risen by 50 cents after a gap of 10% or more from the previous day\u2019s low. Both numbers are customizable via input parameters. Since the strategy is long entry only, you might want to use other strategies for exits, e.g., TrailingStopLX .

        "description": "Description The Golden Triangle (Long Entry) strategy is a moving average based technical indicator developed by Charlotte Hudging in attempt to identify promising entries on stock charts. This strategy is an improvement on a popular \"buy on a dip\" practice that suggests making entries after a significant decline in hope that the price would eventually rise. The main principle of the strategy is to look for accelerating stocks that suddenly fall and then return to the initial uptrend. This sudden fall, anticipated to be a part of a bottom formation, defines the suggested entry point. While seeing bottoms appear on charts is quite common, their uptrend sections might be not as satisfying as one can expect. The Golden Triangle strategy is said to help identify stocks that are likely to regain acceleration. The name of this strategy refers to a geometrical figure that forms on chart when pullback and recovery fragments of the price action satisfy certain criteria. The strategy uses the following criteria for the Golden Triangle identification: Initial uptrend. Golden Triangles form after an uptrend, so the strategy initially looks for a stock's price that rises faster than its moving average. By default, the 50 period simple moving average (SMA) is used. Pivot point. This point defines where the price switches to a short-term downtrend. Price drop. After the pivot, price needs to drop below its SMA and maintain this level throughout the price drop. This defines the initial setup of the Golden Triangle. When the mentioned criteria are met, the strategy looks for price and volume confirmation to add a simulated Buy order. The price confirms when after the previously described downfall, it finally closes above its confirmation SMA. The volume confirms when it is at highest within last several days and greater than its long-term SMA. The volume needs to confirm on the same day the price confirmation happens or on a later day when the close price is greater than its previous value. Input Parameters average length The number of bars used in calculation of the long-term SMA. This SMA is calculated for both price and volume. confirmation length The number of bars used in calculation of the short-term confirmation SMA of price. volume length Defines the confirmation period upon which the highest volume is found.

This approach was described by Markos Katsanos in his article \"Detecting Flags in Intraday Charts.\" Although intraday flags have the same geometric principles as daily ones, it is suggested that the former conform to more strict criteria. These apply mostly to the shape of flag elements (the pole and the flag itself) and their duration. You can customize the criteria in the input parameters, however, the current article discusses their default values. A simulated entry order is added when the flag is identified and all of the following is true: There is currently no open market position; The flag pole height is at least 5.5 times the average true range (ATR) and its formation takes no longer than 23 bars; The flag itself is not wider than 2.5 times the ATR and its formation takes no longer than 15 bars; There is an uptrend before the flag formation and it persists for at least 70 bars; Previous flag formation (if any) occurred at least 50 bars ago; The ATR has changed by at least 5% during the flag formation; A breakout from the formation occurs. When there is an open position, the strategy starts seeking exit possibilities. An exit order is added when any of the following is true: Price reaches the profit target equal to 1.2 times the pole; Price reaches the stop loss or the trailing stop loss (both customizable via input parameters); Inactivity period is longer than 70 bars. Inactivity means that the minimum favorable advance is less than 4 times the ATR; None of the above happens for 100 bars since the entry point.

In order to help you find potential trade candidates, we created the Long Haul Filter study, a thinkScript implementation of Donald Pendregast's stock criteria, adapted for usage in the Stock Hacker Scanning Tool. When an eligible stock is chosen, the strategy can be applied to it. Since its main principle is \"go long only\", Long Haul adds only long simulated orders: Buy To Open (long entry) and Sell to Close (long exit). The long entry simulated order is added when the RSI falls below the oversold level but fails to rise above the overbought level afterwards; it is added to the bar that closes above several previous highs and the slow average.

        "description": "Description The Middle High Low MA (MHL MA) strategy is based on the eponymous study proposed by Vitali Apirine . The strategy adds simulated orders upon crossovers of a regular and a modified moving average (MA and MHL_MA) calculated by the study. The averages share the type and the length, however, the modified moving average is not applied to an OHLC value, but to the price mid-range. The mid-range is defined as the arithmetic mean of the highest high and the lowest low, both found on the same lookback period. According to the study, the relation between the lookback period and the moving average length is as follows: a lookback period of 3 to 15 bars is suggested for moving averages with length of up to 50; periods of 15 to 50 bars are to be combined with moving averages as slow as 50 to 200 bars in length. These numbers are referential and can be easily customized in strategy input parameters. Based on the behavior of the two averages, the strategy adds simulated orders as follows. If MA crosses above MHL_MA, the strategy adds a simulated buy order. Conversely, if MA crosses below MHL_MA, a simulated sell order is added. Input Parameters Parameter Description length Defines the length for calculation of both moving averages. high low length Defines the length of the period upon which the highest high and the lowest low prices are found. average type The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull .

This strategy emulates a stop order at a certain price level: a signal is generated for the next bar at this level if the condition is fulfilled. This price level can be reached at the next bar's opening or during the course of trading. Momentum is calculated as the velocity of change in price over the specified number of bars. When the Momentum becomes a positive value and continues rising, the Long Entry signal is generated at the current High price plus one point (inverted value of the \"price scale\" parameter). Note that if the next Open price is greater than the current High plus one point, it is considered a price level to generate the signal at.

This oscillator incorporates two filters, the Super Smoother Filter and the Roofing Filter , both developed by John F. Ehlers. Data derived from these two filters is processed by automatic gain control algorithm and then subjected to the quotient transform. The quotient transform, controlled by the K coefficient, collapses small oscillator values while keeping higher values high. The strategy uses the oscillator twice, with different values of K coefficient. This ensures more precise trend detection. Suggested values for the coefficient are 0.8 and 0.4, customizable via input parameters. The strategy adds a simulated Buy order when the first oscillator crosses above zero (which corresponds to uptrend detection) and a Sell to close order when the second oscillator crosses below zero (which signifies that the uptrend is over).

This strategy adds entry and exit simulated orders when a swing (a rapid price move of either direction) of a specified type is detected. The strategy recognizes four types of swing: Pivot High-Low. This is a basic pivot point detection method: an upswing is detected if the low price first falls below its previous value, but then rises. Conditions for the downswing are vice versa, based on the high price. Bollinger Bands crossover. An upswing is detected if the price crosses above the lower plot of the Bollinger Bands. A downswing is detected when the price crosses below the upper plot of the Bollinger Bands. RSI Crossover. An upswing is detected if the RSI crosses above the oversold level (which is set by default to 40). A downswing is detected when it crosses below the overbought level (the default value is 60). RSI + Higher Low/Lower High. An upswing is detected if the current low price is greater than its previous value while the RSI is below oversold. A downswing is detected if the current high price is less than its previous value while the RSI is above overbought. The strategy adds a simulated buy-to-open order every time the upswing is detected. Sell-to-open simulated orders are added at downswings.

If the ADX indicates trending conditions, an exponential moving average (EMA) is used for defining trend direction. By default, the strategy employs the 14 period ADX and the 60 period EMA. In case the trend mode is spotted (ADX > 18), Short Exit signals are issued when: PZO values fall below the \"-60\" level and start to go up afterwards, or the price is above EMA (uptrend) and PZO is positive. In non-trending conditions (ADX < 18), these signals are issued when: having surpassed the \"-40\" level, the PZO falls below the \"-60\" level and starts to go up, or having surpassed the \"-40\" level, the PZO rises above zero while the price is above the EMA, or having crossed the \"-5\" level from above, the PZO fails to reach the \"-40\" level and rises above \"+15\". Input Parameters Parameter Description price The price for which the PZO and EMA are calculated. length The number of bars used to calculate the PZO and the ADX. ema length The number of bars used to calculate the EMA.

        "description": "Description As the first step, the R2Trend (RSquared) strategy calculates the RSquared , a technical indicator which measures how closely a data set of close prices conforms to the linear regression trendline. If the correlation is found to be higher than a certain threshold (the default value is 0.42), the strategy measures the steepness of the trendline, using Linear Regression Slope . Based on the premise that steeper slopes signify stronger trends (when the absolute value of the slope found is greater than the specified value), the overall trending conditions are evaluated by the strategy as follows: RSquared values being greater than both a lower threshold ( trend level in the input parameters) and its own prior value while the trendline slope is greater than critical - read as indication of a strong uptrend; RSquared values being greater than both a lower threshold ( trend level in the input parameters) and its own prior value while the trendline slope is less than the negative critical - read as indication of a strong downtrend. The first condition triggers a simulated buy-to open order if the close price rises above its own moving average. Vice versa, a simulated sell-to-open order is added when the second condition is true should the close price fall below the average. Simulated exit orders are added based on crossovers of the close price plot with its moving average: when the close price crosses below the average, a simulated sell-to-close order is added; when it crosses above - the simulation of buy-to-close takes place. Input Parameters length Defines the period for the calculation of the RSquared. r average length Defines the period for the calculation of the moving average for RSquared optimization. lag Defines the lookback period for the prior RSquared value. average length Defines the period for the calculation of the moving average. trend level Defines the minimum RSquared level at which strong trending conditions are recognized. max level Defines the maximum RSquared level at which strong trending conditions are recognized. lr crit level Defines the minimum trendline slope at which strong trending conditions are recognized. average type The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull .

It is based on Mr. Katsanos's technical indicator Regression Divergence and takes its approach even further: instead of two securities statistically analyzed by the indicator, the strategy takes into account three. The Regression Divergence is found between the prices of the current and the secondary symbol while also analyzing the correlation between rates of changes of the current and the tertiary symbol. This approach shows how well two symbols are correlated and how closely the current symbol follows the dynamic of the correlation. The strategy adds simulated buy and sell orders based on the following conditions: - Buy to open. The regression divergence rises above the critical level (set by default to 75) and then promptly reverses its direction while the correlation between the current and the tertiary symbols is below the correlation reference level (which defaults to 0.8). By default, the regression divergence needs to reverse over the next three bars for the signal to be triggered. - Sell to open. The regression divergence falls below the critical level and then promptly (over the next three bars, by default) reverses its direction while the correlation between the current and the tertiary symbols is below the correlation reference level. - Exits (both buy and sell).

Data derived from the Stress Indicator is adapted for hedging and expanded with several safety techniques, such as stop-loss and minimum price. In addition to adding standard simulated buy and sell orders, the Stress strategy marks time points where hedging the instrument with an index could be or could have been useful. It also calculates the hypothetical hedging size for these points. Simulated Trade Orders An initial simulated buy order is added when the Stress Indicator falls below the specified entry level and the index is in uptrend. After an exit, the simulated buy order is only added when the Stress Indicator falls below the entry level from above 50. The simulated sell order is added when any of the following conditions are true: Stress Indicator goes above the exit level; Decline in price from the entry point exceeds the stop-loss percentage value; Price falls below the minimum level at least once during the specified min price length period. Hedging Hedging is treated by the strategy as an independent process solely based on the trend of the chosen index. When index is in downtrend, the strategy indicates that hedging could be useful and calculates the hypothetical hedge size. Here, the downtrend is identified when the average close price of the index falls. The hedging size (i.e., the trading of the index) is calculated as hedge ratio times stock position times stock to index volatility ratio. Both stock volatility and index volatility are calculated using the standard deviation formula. Input Parameters Parameter Description index Defines the index to be used in hedging with the specified stock. length The period upon which the highest and the lowest prices of both the index and the stock are found; used in stochastic calculation. investment Defines hypothetical investment for simulated buy orders. Trade size of the stock is equal to this value divided by close price. entry level Defines the entry level for the simulated buy condition. exit level Defines the exit level for the first simulated sell condition. stop loss Defines the critical percentage of the price decline from the entry point; used in the second simulated sell condition. min price Defines the critical percentage of the price decline from the entry point; used in the third simulated sell condition. min price length Defines the period for the third simulated sell condition. hedge length Defines the period for calculation of standard deviations and average close price of the index. hedge ratio Defines the ratio of the hedge-protected position size to the size of the entire position; used in the index trade size calculation.

These averages form two plots which produce Buy and Sell signals for the strategy. A Buy signal is given when the first average crosses above the second at a bullish bar; conversely, a Sell signal is given when the crossover of opposite direction happens at a bearish bar. These signals also divide the price plot into trending sections: those between consecutive Buy and Sell signals are considered uptrend and colored green while those between consecutive Sell and Buy signals are considered downtrend and colored gray. The plots and coloring system are added to this strategy in order to facilitate your decision whether to use the default parameters or to adjust them.

Based upon the most common technical indicators, such as simple (SMA) and exponential (EMA) moving averages, it is best suitable for volatile, high-volume stocks and ETFs that show smooth, regular swing and/or trend moves. The main principle of the strategy suggests that the entries be taken when their direction is aligned with the trend. In this particular strategy, the trend is determined by the 50 period EMA of the Close price (customizable via strategy input parameters). The strategy also calculates two simple moving averages: SMA of High price and that of the Low price, to be used as signal lines. Once all the three averages are calculated, the strategy will add simulated orders upon the following conditions: A Long Entry order is added when price exceeds the SMA of High price by the specified number of ticks (5 by default) and the previous bar has closed above the EMA; A Long Exit order is added when the Low price fails to exceed its SMA; A Short Entry condition is inverse of the Long Entry one: it is added when price falls below the SMA of Low price minus the specified number of ticks and the previous bar has closed below the EMA; A Short Exit order is added when the High price goes above its SMA.

        "description": "Description The Technical Stock Rating strategy is based on a stock rating system developed by Markos Katsanos. The strategy uses rating scores provided by the eponymous study to add simulated buy orders. The score is calculated based on stock performance in terms of meeting five technical analysis criteria. The following criteria are taken into account when assigning a rating to a stock symbol: Money flow: This criterion is met if the symbol's current Volume Flow Indicator value is positive. Trading above average: This criterion is met if the close price is greater than its simple moving average (SMA). In uptrend: This criterion is met if the SMA value has increased over the last four bars. Trend quality: This criterion is met if the total number of crossovers between the price and its moving average during the lookup period does not exceed a certain value. Overall market direction: This criterion is met if the exponential moving average of the appropriate market index has increased over the last two bars. The stock symbol receives one point for meeting each of the above criteria if all the weights are set to 1.0. By default, only the \"overall market direction\" weight is equal to 2.0; however, you are free to assign the weights according to your preferences. By default, the strategy adds a simulated buy to open order if the currently selected stock receives a rating score of 5.0 or higher.

        "description": "Description The Three Period Divergence strategy is a trading system developed by Perry Kaufman, which is based upon analysis of momentum-price divergence. Best applied to daily price data, this strategy identifies time points where a momentum indicator (in our case, the Stochastic ) and the price move away from each other. Divergences occur in two directions: a bearish divergence is identified when the price rises and the momentum falls, a bullish divergence is vice versa. While looking for divergences is quite a popular technique to follow, it is not always obvious which timeframe should be used or even how the divergence can be determined. Moreover, divergence signals can often be misleading, thus confirmation of these signals is crucial. Three Period Divergence addresses these problems as follows: Divergence is looked for based on linear regression slopes of the momentum (either the FastK or the FastD component of the Stochastic) and the price; Momentum needs to be defined on the period from five to 40 days; Linear regression slopes for both the price and the momentum are found on three periods (Mr. Kaufman suggests that the first period be 5 days, the second period from six to 12, and the third one from seven to 15); Divergence occurs when the signs of the momentum slope and the price slope are opposite; In order to confirm the divergence, momentum slope is compared to the price slope on each of the calculation periods (the divergences must be all in the same direction). Note: these periods are defined here as ranges; this is due to the fact that suitable periods differ from symbol to symbol, thus the strategy allows for optimization. Note also that searching for the divergence on each of the three calculation periods might reduce the number of signals. However, changing input parameters will allow you to search where the divergence occurs on at least two (or even one) of the three periods. Once the divergence is identified, strategy adds simulated orders based on the dollowing rules: a buy signal is added when the bearish divergence occurs on the specified number of calculation periods out of three, and a sell signal when the bullish divergence is identified (on the same number of periods). Strategy will exit when all three price slopes are of the same sign as those of the momentum. Input Parameters Parameter Description fast momentum Defines whether the momentum is calculated as the FastK component of the Stochastic (otherwise the FastD component is used). momentum length Defines the period on which the momentum is calculated. dvg length1 Defines the shortest of the periods for the calculation of slopes. dvg length2 Defines the middle period for the calculation of slopes. dvg length3 Defines the longest of the periods for the calculation of slopes. entry number Defines the number of divergences sufficient for signal generation. max divergences Defines on how many periods the price and the momentum need to move in the same direction for the strategy to exit. long only Setting this input to \"yes\" will disable all short entry and short exit simulated orders.

        "description": "Description The VIX Timing strategy is a forecasting tool which uses Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index (VIX) in order to indicate buying or selling opportunities for broad-based indexes like the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The VIX is sometimes called \"the fear index\"; it represents implied volatility in the stock market for the next 30 days. According to the rules described by Trent Gardner in his article \"Using VIX To Forecast The S&P 500\", orders are added upon the following conditions: Buy order is added after the VIX has constantly been below its SMA during trend period, Sell order is added after the VIX has constantly been above its SMA during trend period. Input Parameters Parameter Description price The price used in calculation of VIX. sma length The number of bars used in calculation of SMA. trend length The number of bars in the period upon which the VIX is compared to its SMA.

        "description": "Description The Volatility Band strategy generates trading signals determined by volatility-based boundaries. Like in several other volatility band indicators, these boundaries are placed a number of deviations above and below a mean price value; for Volatility Band, this value is equal by default to simple moving average (SMA) of exponentially smoothed typical price (hlc3) . Deviations are based on the difference between typical and Low price of adjacent bars, taking into account whether the typical price is greater or less than its previous value (for more detailed information on mathematics involved, refer to Sylvain Vervoort's article \"Within the Volatility Band\" published in August 2013 issue of \"Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities\"). According to S. Vervoort's observations, prices tend to reach the upper band more often than the lower one; this issue is addressed by using an adjustment factor for the lower band, i.e., the multiplier that makes lower band's shift from the middle line not equal to that of the upper band. Buy signal is generated when Close price gets higher than the upper band; Sell signal when it falls below the lower band. Input Parameters Parameter Description price The price with which the middle line is calculated. average length The number of bars used to calculate the SMA. volatility length The number of bars used to calculate the third ADX for TAC_ADX. deviation factor The number of deviations determining the distance between the middle line and the upper band. low band adjust Adjustment factor for the lower band Plots Plot Description MidLine The middle line, SMA of exponentially smoothed price data. UpperBand The upper band. LowerBand The lower band. Further Reading 1. \"Within the Volatility Band\" by Sylvain Vervoort. Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities, August 2013.

        "description": "Description The VolSwitch strategy is based upon the Volatility Switch study in combination with such indicators as Relative Strength Index (RSI) and simple moving average (SMA) . If the Volatility Switch indicates a trending mode of market, a Buy signal is given when the close (or another price specified in inputs) crosses above its SMA, and a Sell signal is given when it crosses below. If the market is in mean reversion mode suggested by the study, the Buy signal is indicated when the RSI crosses above the oversold level, and, vice versa, the Sell signal is indicated when it crosses below the overbought level. Input Parameters Parameter Description price Defines price in Volatility Switch, SMA, and RSI calculations. length Defines the period used in Volatility Switch calculation. average length The number of bars used in calculation of the SMA. rsi length The number of bars used in calculation of the RSI. rsi overbought level Defines the overbought value for the RSI. rsi oversold level Defines the oversold value for the RSI. rsi average type The type of moving average to be used in calculations: simple , exponential , weighted , Wilder's , or Hull .

        "description": "Description The VWMA Breakouts strategy is a moving average-based breakout indicator designed by Ken Calhoun for swing trading in volatile markets. Its main purpose is to combine the beneficial properties of a simple moving average and a volume-weighted one. As the name implies, the volume-weighted moving average (VWMA) assigns different weights to the close price when calculating the average; greater weights being assigned to close price readings that have shown higher volume. The indicator consists of two lines: an SMA of the close price, which acts as a trendline, and a VWMA line, being a signal line. When the price rises on high volume, the VWMA line is likely to be seen moving further away from the SMA, which may be regarded as a signal for uptrend continuation. Simulated trade signals are given upon crossovers of the VWMA and the SMA. When the VWMA crosses above the SMA, a buy to open signal is indicated. When it falls back below the SMA, a sell to close signal is given. By default, a 50-period VWMA and a 70-period SMA lines are calculated; these values are suggested by the author for use on 15-day 15-minute charts. These values as well as the type of the moving average to be used as the trendline can be modified in the input parameters. Input Parameters Parameter Description vwma length The length of the volume-weighted moving average. ma length The length of the moving average to be used as the trendline. average type The type of the moving average to be used as the trendline. Plots Plot Description VWMA The plot of the signal volume-weighted moving average. MA The plot of the trendline moving average.
